For supply of data to the Open South Data Project for future use by researchers in the Global South
  
BACKGROUND 
The Open South Data Project (“Repository”) is an online data platform powered and developed by EAAMO (Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization) to provide a single point where researchers, policy-makers, students, data practitioners, non-governmental organizations and related entities in the Global South can access, share, and freely explore non-sensitive, fully anonymized research datasets.
 
The Repository provides a place where Global South researchers can both share data they have generated (as a “Data Provider”) and access existing data that is available in the Repository (as a “Data Accessor”).  Data Providers shall be required to sign this “Data Provider Agreement” prior to sharing data.  Data Accessors can search for data to support their research areas, and that data shall be freely available to download and use once a Data Accessor has signed to accept the required “Data Access Agreement.”  Once a Data Accessor consents to this agreement for the first time, they will be granted access to utilize the Open South system. Continued use of the system requires adherence to the terms and conditions stipulated in this agreement.

 
This Data Provider Agreement sets forth the terms under which data are supplied to the Repository by a Data Provider.
